    "This workshop is called Data Science <i>for</i> Social Justice. Our goal is to build programmatic and data science skills, grounded in a politics of justice, to better inform our advocacy as machine learning and AI tools are increasingly used in society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you‚Äôre new to programming, the ability to collect and analyze data independently means you no longer have to take people in power at their word when they tell you what \"the data\" says. You can find data, evalute it, analyze it, and present your own findings. This will help you decide who you can trust, and help you find a voice in speaking truth to power. At the same time, you can speak with greater authority when data science and machine learning products are used improperly in society, because you yourself have developed the technical skills to interact with these products on a deeper level.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we begin by building a foundation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",

    "üìù **Poll**: Have you used Python, or another programming language before? What have you used it for?\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction to Python is built around **data analysis**, although many of these skills will be useful for other applications of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be using in this workshop comes from the social media platform [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com). We will specifically use data from a subreddit, or a sub-community in Reddit, called [r/amitheasshole](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole). \n",
    "\n",
    "The subreddit describes itself as \"A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We've scraped many of the comments from this subreddit, and placed them in a file that looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/aita_ex.png\" alt=\"gapminder_data\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a data scientist wanting to perform an exploratory data analysis on this dataset, using the basics of Python. By the end of this workshop, you'll be doing just that."
