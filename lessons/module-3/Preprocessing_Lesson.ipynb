    "# About This Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common types of data used in machine learning and data science is text data. This includes social media posts, novels, customer reviews, interview transcripts, and many others. Text is a powerful source of information, but requires specific preprocessing in order to be used in machine learning contexts. In particular, machine learning algorithms are designed to work with numerical data, so the end goal of text preprocessing is to have numeric features associated with each text in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will go over a preprocessing **pipeline** (or series of sequential steps) for text, which is the first step that we need to take in order to analyze text using our data science techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to help you: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read, manipulate, and write `.csv` files in a `pandas` dataframe;\n",
    "2. Preprocess text with the following key skills: tokenizing, stop-word removal, n-grams extraction, and lemmatization using `spaCy`;\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python Fundamentals, you were introduced to the basics of the `pandas` package, which we will use extensively in this notebook. This module is designed to accelerate your coding skills so that you can use Python effectively for generating research results. However, if you have less experience with Python, some of this will be overwhelming. That's totally normal, since it takes more than a couple of hours to learn how to code! \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are feeling overwhelmed, it can be helpful to focus on the broader purpose of the functions in the notebook for now and how we can use them to further our research purposes, rather than the details of the algorithms. It can also help to remember that you don't need to memorize every function you want to use. Even programmers who have been working with Python for years will regularly refer to documentation and resources (like this notebook!) while they are developing a project. With time and experience as you progress through the notebooks you will get more comfortable with the Python code underlying this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Some of the code will take a long time to execute. The `*` on the left side of the cell will indicate that the cell is still running. The nice thing about preprocessing is that once we have the pipeline complete, we will save our results so we don't need to re-run these cells."

    "# Preprocessing Text Data with SpaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data collected in the real world is always going to be variable, which poses a challenge for analysis. But by reducing some of this variation, we can help improve our results. For example, if we are counting instances of the word `\"weather\"` in text, we might want the strings `\"weather\"`, `\"weather.\"`, and `\"Weather\"` to all be counted as instances of the same word. However, in raw text form, these would be treated as separate strings. By performing text cleaning, we can standardize these cases and make our data easier to analyze. Some common preprocessing steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing punctuation\n",
    "- Removing URLs\n",
    "- Removing stopwords (non-content words like \"a\", \"the\", \"is\", etc.)\n",
    "- Lowercasing\n",
    "- Tokenization (e.g., splitting a sentence into distinct \"chunks\" or \"tokens\")\n",
    "- Lemmatization, or changing words to 'dictionary form' (e.g., runs, running, ran -> run)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we don't need to code every one of these steps. Instead, we will use a package called [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to do these things. If the text you'd like to process is general-purpose English language text (i.e., not domain-specific, like medical literature), `spaCy` is ready to use out-of-the-box. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we need to do one more installation: the underlying language \"pipeline\" that spaCy uses. This pipeline contains all the rules and code spaCy uses to perform text preprocessing. Using this pipeline, spaCy will extract information about **attributes** of our text: the tokens, lemmas, stopwords, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common pipeline to use is the [`en_core_web_sm`](https://spacy.io/models/en/#en_core_web_sm) pipeline, which is the English (\"en\") model, which contains many \"core\" functions, is developed partially with \"web\" data, and is the small version (\"sm\")."

    "\n",
    "Many kinds of NLP methods work better when using **N-grams**. An n-gram treats small groups of words as tokens rather than single words. This allows words that frequently appearing together to be concatenated (e.g. \"new york\" means something different and more specific than \"new\" and \"york\" separately). We most commonly use **bigrams** (2-word phrases) and **trigrams** (3-word phrases).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phrase modeling** is an approach to learning combinations of tokens that together represent meaningful multi-word concepts. So rather than treating every pair of words as a n-gram, we look for pairs that occur together frequently and identify those as n-grams. This constrains the token space by limiting the number of multi-word tokens, but requires information about what words co-occur together frequently, which is where **phrase models** come in. We can develop phrase models by looping over the the words in our lemmatized dataset and looking for words that co-occur (i.e., appear one after another) together much more frequently than you would expect them to by random chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "`gensim` is a popular natural language processing package. We will use it in later lessons for topic modeling and word embeddings. It also contains a [`Phrases`](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/phrases.html) model that implements phrase modeling for identifying bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams, etc. `Phrases` detects phrases based on collocation counts. It builds a model of input text that you then can use on other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`gensim` detects a bigram if a scoring function for two words exceeds a threshold. The two important arguments to `Phrases` are `min_count` and `threshold`. The higher the values of these parameters, the harder it is for words to be combined to bigrams. We can change the value of these parameters to fine-tune our model. Try changing `min count` and `threshold` below. How does that change the output?"
