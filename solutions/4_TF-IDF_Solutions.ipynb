When I told them where we'd plan our honeymoon they said how jealous they are and how they wish they could also go. I told them that we could consider the idea of making this a friend inclusive honeymoon and they were very excited with the idea. Sadly for many years we hadn't been able to plan the trip with the guys to that place because our conflicting schedules but now pretty much is easier for us to be able to align our vacation days. So I thought this was a great chance.\\n\\nI announced it to my fianc√©e the other day and I thought she'd find it a cool idea but she got completely mad at me and started crying and telling me how much of an inconsiderate AH I am. I tried to explain to her I didn't do it with malice I simply thought it would be a good chance for the guys to experience it and I even told her she can tell some of her own friends of they want to join.\\n\\nShe told me that I'm ridiculous for insisting that this is a good idea and how she felt horrible because I'm inconsiderate because I made my honeymoon into a friendship trip when it's supposed to be about us two. She also says I'm an even bigger AH for discussing it with my friends and getting them excited about it when I didn't consult her and honestly I think she's right on that part and I might be TA.\\n\\nOn the idea though, I didn't think she'd mind that much.
